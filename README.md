# skype-message
This is a simple Skype integration script for automated messaging where I use CronTab as a Task manager


For the crontrab the following code was this:

0 9 * * 1-6 /usr/local/bin/python3.9 /Users/macbook/Documents/script/main.py

Every day from Monday to Friday he will run this script at 9:00 am
